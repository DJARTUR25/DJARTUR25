- Hi, I’m @DJARTUR25, in a simple way you can call me Grigoriy. I am a 3rd year student in UNN in Nizhniy Novgorod, department of Differential Equations, Mathematical and Numerical Analysis.
  
- I'm interested in programming on Python, C++. I am also currently studying Numerical Methods and C#. 
  
- Currently learning Python, C++ and C#; want to start learning Go-language or Java.
  
- Right now I'm writing term paper on Numerical Methods. Topic of my work: "Numerical solution of the unsteady equation of thermal conductivity with convection and diffusion". Software implementation of this work you can find in my pins: 'CHM_KSR'.
  
- You can find me in VK or Telegram by my nickname @djartur25.
